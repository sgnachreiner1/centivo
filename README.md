I added some routes to 'routes/userRoutes.ts' that would allow us to fetch all users and get a specific user by ID (will return the user unless the user is 21 or under -- otherwise will return that the user is not found). The actual fetch to MongoDB exists in 'services/userService.ts'. I also used TypeScript because I like the early error catching benefits that strong typing provides.

In order to test, you will need a MongoDB instance running and populated with some sample data. Change the properties in '.env' to suit your MongoDB instance. Feel free to test by launching the application using `npm run dev` in the project directory and then going to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. `http://localhost:3000/users/` and `http://localhost:3000/users/:id/` should both work correctly.
